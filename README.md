A voxel engine that I programmed in C using OpenGL along with some libraries: cglm for maths, glad for OpenGL functions, GLFW for windowing and input, FastNoiseLite for noise functions, and stb for loading images.

The game is still being developed so the latest source code may not currently be playable.

To run first clone the git respository then do the following:
```
mkdir build
make
```
And then run the executable inside the build directory.
