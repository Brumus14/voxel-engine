When modifying chunk, remesh neighbors if necessary
    Don't mesh blocks on chunk borders so wait for bordering chunks to generate terrain
Check for any race conditions / multithreading bugs (potentially to do with chunk iteration)
Improve meshing like greedy meshing
Sometimes get invalid frees probably due to multithreading issues
Reimplement collision
Gravity
Make flying more responsive
Better lighting
Blocks orient correctly when placed
Bug when moving fast: malloc(): unsorted double linked list corrupted
Frustum culling
Allow workers to schedule tasks for chain tasking
Maybe when modifying chunk don't re-mesh entire chunk just modified part
When moving fast lots of chunks are scheduled even if they're now out of render distance
Maybe rework chunk iteration as lots of argument parsing, maybe just access internal hash map
Maybe rework worker as lots of argument parsing
Chunk occlusion culling
I think rendering is like blocked especially noticable when initially generating lots of chunks
Break out of worker tasks early by checking unloaded flag
Pass by reference more
